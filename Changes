  - No longer reset all attributes upon calling attribute functions with
    zero args. Only the relevant attribute will be reset.
  - Calling fg() and bg() with zero args will now reset the foreground /
    background color.
  - Add a new feature that allows for passing a raw combination of
    colors and attributes to the coloring functions.
  - Stop using 38;<attribute> since it's broken because of broken
    implementation in terminals.
