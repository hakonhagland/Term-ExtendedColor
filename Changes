0.499: major rework since 0.302: possibly breaking someones code, somewhere.

       No longer reset all attributes upon calling attribute functions
       in void context: only the relevant attribute will be reset. fg()
       and bg() now resets the foreground and background color properly
       when called with zero args.

       The clear() function still resets all attributes.
       See the scripts in examples/ directory.

       Stop using 38;<attribute> since it's broken because of broken
       implementation in terminals [0], [1].

       Add a new feature that allows you to pass a raw combination of
       colors and attributes to the coloring functions.

       fg('38;5;197;48;5;53;1;3;4;5;7', 'this is perfectly legal');
